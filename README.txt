Hello! If you are reading this, welcome! Here I am outlining the goals of this project.

My goals:

-Create an HTML page with a mix of imgs, divs, forms, headings, etc. to create a bare-bones mock shopping website
-Add CSS to the page so it doesn't look so bad
-Add MINIMAL js code so that on click for certain functions, it reads as the function being called
-Create cards that change appearance when hovering over with the mouse


Annnnd that's basically it! Just a simple mock website, a simple poster if you will. What this project is NOT:

-A functioning shop site, with full js code
-A React project, with dynamic features
-Anything complex, really


I just want to develop my HTML and CSS abilities a bit more - so, uh, yeah! Just a fun little project that I will put up on 10.15.23, and may return to later.


Final update: Putting this project on hold going forward. I did not get all my goals accomplished, but that's okay. As a recap for what I did: I created a web page with a miz of elements and some css. Some other time I may use this code as building blocks for another project - for now I am done with it, however.

Let's go over some interesting feats:
I created different classes to add uniqueness to elements
I played with the form element and added placeholder text
I added some animation on CSS

This is all good, and can be built upon later, when I have a better project idea. My creativity ran out and I did not know what to do with the designs - I may decide to recreate a webpage later.
