Hello! If you are reading this, welcome! Here I am outlining the goals of this project.

My goals:

-Create an HTML page with a mix of imgs, divs, forms, headings, etc. to create a bare-bones mock shopping website
-Add CSS to the page so it doesn't look so bad
-Add MINIMAL js code so that on click for certain functions, it reads as the function being called
-Create cards that change appearance when hovering over with the mouse


Annnnd that's basically it! Just a simple mock website, a simple poster if you will. What this project is NOT:

-A functioning shop site, with full js code
-A React project, with dynamic features
-Anything complex, really


I just want to develop my HTML and CSS abilities a bit more - so, uh, yeah! Just a fun little project that I will put up on 10.15.23, and may return to later.
